# horiseon-refactor

## Description

My goal in this project was to organize, simplify, and replace existing code in order to meet the acceptance criteria. I restructured the html file in addition to replacing existing tags with semantic tags to provide more structure and clarity to the file. Then I adjusted the css file to reflect that changes I had made in the html and to make sure the site visually looked accessible and organized. Lastly, I added comments to the css file to further provide clarity and structure to the file.
